# Mobile Software Engineering - Assignment 2

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of Assignment 2 for the Mobile Software Engineering course. The application demonstrates the use of explicit and implicit intents to navigate between two activities in an Android application.

## Features
- Main activity displaying student information
- Navigation between activities using both explicit and implicit intents
- Second activity showing common mobile software engineering challenges
- Simple user interface built with Jetpack Compose

## Implementation Details
- Language: Kotlin
- UI Framework: Jetpack Compose
- Target Android API: 34 (Android 14)
- Minimum SDK: API 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat)

## Testing Environment
- Android Version: Android 14 (emulator)

## Project Structure
- `MainActivity.kt`: Entry point of the application displaying student information and navigation buttons
- `SecondActivity.kt`: Secondary screen displaying mobile software engineering challenges
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: Contains activity declarations and intent filter for implicit intents

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Connect an Android device or start an emulator
4. Click "Run" in Android Studio
